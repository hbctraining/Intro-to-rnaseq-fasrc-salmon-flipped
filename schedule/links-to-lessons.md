# Bulk RNA-seq Data Analysis using High-Performance Computing (bulk RNA-seq Part I -- FASTQ to counts)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
- Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.

## Installations

***All:***

* [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) (make sure you get â€˜FileZilla Client')

***Mac users:***

* Plain text editor like [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or similar

***Windows users:***

* [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Plain text editor like [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or similar

## Notes
* These materials focus on the use of local computational resources at Harvard, which are **only accessible to Harvard affiliates**
* Non-Harvard folks can [download the data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3lua2h1oo18gbug/unix_lesson.tar.gz?dl=1) and set up to work on their local clusters (with the help of local system administrators)

## Cluster access
To run through the code in the lessons below, you will need a FAS-RC cluster account. Once you have an account, please do the following.

1. Log in using `ssh username@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu` and enter your password (replace username with your username). 
2. Once you are on the login node, use `salloc -p test -t 0-2:30 --mem 8G` to get on a compute node or as specified in the lesson.
3. Proceed only once your command prompt does not have the word `login` in it.
4. If you log out between lessons (using the `exit` command twice), please follow points 1. and 2. above to log back in and get on a compute node when you restart with the self learning.
