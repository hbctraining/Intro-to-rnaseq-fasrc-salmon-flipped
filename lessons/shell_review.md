## Learning Objectives
- Review shell commands and concepts


## Setting up

This workshop assumes that you have either a) taken our [Introduction to command-line interface workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/) or b) been working on the command-line and are already fluent with shell/bash. **We ask that you complete the exercises below**, to refresh some basic commands that you will be using over the course of the workshop. For each section we have relevant materials linked as a helpful reference. 

### Opening up a terminal window

> *NOTE: This mandatory pre-work does not require you to login to the FAS-RC cluster.*

On your local laptop, you will need to open up your terminal window. This will be different depending on what kind of operating system (OS) you are working on.

**With Mac OS**

Macs have a utility application called "**Terminal**" for performing tasks on the command line (shell), both locally and on remote machines. 

Please find and open the Terminal utility on your computers using the *Spotlight Search* at the top right hand corner of your screen.

**With Windows OS**

By default, there is no built-in Terminal that uses the bash shell on the Windows OS. So, we will be using a downloaded program called "**Git BASH**" which is part of the [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) tool set. **Git BASH is a shell/bash emulator.** What this means is that it shows you a very similar interface to, and provides you the functionality of, the Terminal utility found on the Mac and Linux Operating systems.

Please find and open Git BASH.

> **Tip** - Windows users can use another program called [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) instead of a *bash emulator* to log in to remote machines, but it is a little more involved and has different capabilities. We encourage you to take a look at it, but we will not be covering it in this workshop.

### Downloading the example data folder

The data you will be working with can be downloaded using the link below. Clicking on the link will automatically place a file called `unix_lesson.zip` to your `Downloads` folder on your computer.

- [Introduction to Shell: Dataset](https://github.com/hbctraining/Training-modules/blob/master/Intro_shell/data/unix_lesson.zip?raw=true)

Now, in you terminal window change directories into your `Downloads` folder and check that the file is listed there:

```bash
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ ls -l unix_lesson.zip 
```

> Note: Your OS may automatically decompress the unix_lesson.zip once it has been downloaded. If so, it wil simply show up as unix_lesson in your `~/Downloads` folder. If this is the case, you can skip the step below decompressing the data.

To decompress the file into a folder called `unix_lesson` we use the `unzip` command:

```bash
$ unzip unix_lesson.zip
```

Check to see that you have the folder `unix_lesson` before proceeding.

```bash
$ ls -l unix_lesson
```

## Reviewing shell commands

### Shell basics
We are going to start this review with some basic commands pertaining to navigating around the filesystem. Helpful reference materials are listed below:

* [Introduction to Shell](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/lessons/01_the_filesystem.html)
* [Wildcards and shortcuts in Shell](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/lessons/02_wildcards_shortcuts.html)
* [Examining and creating files](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/03_working_with_files.html)

1. Change directory into the `unix_lesson/` directory.
2. Take a quick look at the `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq` file (located in `raw_fastq` directory) using `less` from `unix_lesson/`, without changing directories.
3. Use a shortcut to move out of the directory to the parent of `unix_lesson/`.
4. Change directories into the `raw_fastq/` folder with a single command.
5. What does the `~` in the command prompt mean?
6. What is the full path to the `unix_lesson` directory?
8. List all the files in the `raw_fastq` directory.
8. Modify the above command using the `*` wildcard to only list those files that have "oe" in their names.
10. How many and which commands have you run so far?

### Searching and redirection
Next, we will search our files for specific patterns and redirect the results to file. Helpful reference materials are listed below:

* [Searching and redirection](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/04_searching_files.html)

12. Create a new directory called `shell_review/` within the `unix_lesson/` directory.
13. Search the file `unix_lesson/reference_data/chr1-hg19_genes.gtf` for lines containing the string "MOV10". Save the output in the `shell_review/` directory with a new name - "Mov10_hg19.gtf".
14. Use `vim` to open the newly created file `unix_lesson/shell_review/Mov10_hg19.gtf` and add a comment at the top specifying how this file was created and the source of the content. Save the modified file and quit `vim`.
15. In the new file "Mov10_hg19.gtf", how many lines contain the word "exon"?

### Loops and shell scripts

* [Shell scripts and variables in Shell](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/05_shell-scripts_variable.html)
* [Loops and automation](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/06_loops_and_automation.html)

16. Use the `for` loop to iterate over each FASTQ file in `raw_fastq` and do the following:
      * Print the name of the current file
      * Generate a prefix to use for naming our output files, and store it inside a variable called `sample`.
      * Dump out the first 40 lines into a new file that will be saved in `shell_review`
17. Place the above `for` loop into a shell script using `vim` and run it.

### Permissions

* [Interpreting the permissions string](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/lessons/07_permissions_and_environment_variables.html#permissions)

There is a folder in the HBC training shared space on the FAS-RC cluster called `intro_rnaseq_hpc`. Below we have displayed a long listing of its contents.

```

18. How many owners have files in this folder?
19. How many groups?
20. Are there any executable *files* in this folder?
21. What kind of access does the user `mm573` have to the `full_dataset/` directory?
22. You are considered as "other" or everyone else on this system (i.e you are not part of the group `hbctraining`. What command would allow the user `mm573` do to take away your ability to look inside the `full_dataset/` directory?


### Environment variables

* [Understanding environment variables](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-fasrc-flipped/lessons/07_permissions_and_environment_variables.html#environment-variables)

23. Display the contents of the `$HOME` variable on your computer.
24. Use the `which` command to check where the executable file for the `pwd` command lives in the directory structure.
25. How does shell know where to find the executable file for the `pwd` command?
26. Display the contents of the variable that stores the various paths to folders containing executable command files.
